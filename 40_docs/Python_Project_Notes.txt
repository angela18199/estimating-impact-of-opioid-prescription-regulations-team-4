Preparation for python project

1. Variables we need
	County Name
	County FIPS
	County Population
	County Opioid OD Deaths
	Opioid Deaths Per Capita (Calculation)
	State
	Year Of Observations
	Year When Opioid Law Changes made
	Opioid Shipments

	Maybe more, but I think these should answer his questions

2. What samples need to be covered
	States of Washington, Florida, and Texas
	Other states also need to be examined that did not change opioid laws (maybe ones of a similar size or similar geographic location, to
	ensure reduction in other variables. I would recommend Oregon, California, and Georgia, though if we can more could work. Also, need
	to check opioid laws in these states. That may require outside information.
	
	All counties in at least these six states. Maybe all other states instead.

	Opioid laws are between 2007 and 2011. Therefore, our years should bracket these years. I would recommend at least three years before 2007
	and three years after 2011. Seems we have only 2006 and 2012 though
	(I do not know what is standard in this field, maybe ask Nick how many years would make it signficificant. 
	Could go up to 5 if we have the data)

3. Single row of data
	County State,
	County Name,
	County FIPS,
	County Opioid Deaths Per Capita,
	Year Of Observations,
	Year When Law Changed,
	County Opioid Deaths,
	County Population,
	Opioid Shipments

4. What do I need to do to get this dataset?

	Combine County population, state, county name, county FIPS code, law change, and observations into a single table. Calculate deaths per capita

5. Source and Intermediate Datasets
	County_FIPS
	pop_counties_2006_2012.csv
	Opioid Shipment Informations

Feel free to make additions or changes
